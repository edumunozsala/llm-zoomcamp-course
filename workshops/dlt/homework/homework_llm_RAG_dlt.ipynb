Load the data incrementally\n","\n","  Incremental loading is a very important aspect of building scalable data pipelines. It is the technique of loading only the new or changed data since the last run of the pipeline.\n","\n","  In our case, when we first run the pipeline, all paragraphs from the employee handbook will get loaded as separate rows inside a lancedb table. Now if we change the content of one of the paragraphs and re-run the pipeline to update the table, then without doing incremental loading, one of two things may happen depending on the option we choose:\n","  - If we choose the option \"replace\", then the existing data in lancedb will be dropped, and all of the paragraphs will be reloaded.\n","  - If we choose the option \"append\", then the existing rows would remain and all of the paragraphs would be loaded again as new rows resulting in twice as many rows\n","\n","  To ensure that only the new/changed rows are loaded we would need the following pieces:\n","  - A column that can keep track of changes in the row (Example: only load rows where `last_edited_time` is greater than the current maximum `last_edited_time`)\n","  - A primary_key column that uniquely identify a row, so it's possible to track when the row changes\n","  - A strategy to resolve changes in a single row (example: drop current and load the changed row)\n","\n","  This behaviour can be configured easily into a dlt rersource:\n","  - Pass the incremental column as a parameter inside the resource\n","    ```python\n","    def rest_api_notion_incremental(\n","      last_edited_time = dlt.sources.incremental(\"last_edited_time\", initial_value=\"2024-06-26T08:16:00.000Z\",primary_key=(\"block_id\"))\n","    ):\n","    ```\n","    We choose the column `last_edited_time` since it keeps track of whenever a paragraph changes.\n","  - Pass the following arguments inside `@dlt.resource` to define the strategy for dealing with duplicate rows:\n","    - `write_disposition=\"merge\"`: ensures that any duplicate rows are merged on the primary key\n","    - `primary_key=\"block_id\"`: specifies the primary key that we'd like to merge on. In our case, this is `block_id`, which is a unique id corresponding to each block (paragraph).\n","    - `columns={\"last_edited_time\":{\"dedup_sort\":\"desc\"}}`: this specifies the deduplication strategy (how we would like to resolve duplicate rows). Here we chose to keep the row with the largest value of `last_edited_time`.\n","\n","    Putting it together:\n","\n","    ```python\n","    @dlt.resource(\n","        name=\"employee_handbook\",\n","        write_disposition=\"merge\",\n","        primary_key=\"block_id\",\n","        columns={\"last_edited_time\":{\"dedup_sort\":\"desc\"}}\n","    )\n","    def rest_api_notion_incremental(\n","        last_edited_time = dlt.sources.incremental(\"last_edited_time\", initial_value=\"2024-06-26T08:16:00.000Z\",primary_key=(\"block_id\"))\n","    ):\n","        for block in rest_api_notion_resource.add_map(extract_page_content):   \n","            if not(len(block[\"content\"])):\n","                continue\n","            yield block\n","  ```\n","  Here, `rest_api_notion_resoure` yields the JSON response from the Notion REST API and `extract_page_content` is the transformation function that we pass the JSON response through."],"metadata":{"id":"eTGdAXpKs8Pb"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["5.
